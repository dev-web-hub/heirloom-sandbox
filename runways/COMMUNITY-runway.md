# Runway Prompt Â· COMMUNITY

This file sets the natural-language runway for capsule **COMMUNITY**.

- Context: describe what this capsule is for.
- Workflow: describe how COMMUNITY should behave step by step.
- Output rules: how granular outputs should be (snippets, stubs, drafts).
- Priority: note if COMMUNITY is MVP-critical or can be postponed.

(Expand this with real guidance as each capsule matures.)
