# Heirloom Sandbox

A modular system of "capsules" (Mother, ScriptCat, Ads, Socials, etc.)  
Each capsule has:
- **Heirloom seed** (machine seed prompt, cryptographic style)  
- **Runway prompt** (human natural-language scaffold)  
- **State folder** (external brain storage)

This repo is the local-first, Git-backed foundation for orchestration.
